This file contains the updated stepup checklist structure with all required sections based on your SOP.

I will now manually update the app.js file with the complete checklist that includes:

1. Order Type & Patient Status
2. Current BMI Verification
3. PUE Verification (with Scenario H provider legitimacy)
4. Titration & Gap Rules (corrected per SOP)
5. Current Photos (Scenarios I & J)
6. SCR Mental Health & Hospitalization (suicidal ideation, bariatric surgery, GLP-1 hospitalization)
7. Final Outcomes & Documentation

Total: 20 checks (c1-c20)
