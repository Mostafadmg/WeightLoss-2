Periodic Review Requirements
Applies to: Repeat Mounjaro and Wegovy patients
Eligibility Timing: 6-12-18 months from their rst GLP1 order, regardless of provider
Eligibility Criterion: Not achieved overall weight loss of 5%
Nevolat Di erent Timing: Check-ins after 4 months for patients who have not
achieved 5% overall weight loss
Reference: Periodic Review SOP for further details
Clock Reset: Resets when patient switches GLP1 product

Important Note: If multiple checks fail, only one email sent covering all information
requirements
Email Protocol: Avoid use of automated CRM emails when patient on-hold before or
multiple checks failed
Reference: Tags Guide on Con uence for di erent tags referenced
4.3.1: Assisted Prescribing
Visible in lter function on prescribing interface
Reference: Assisted Prescribe SOP for further information
Current Status: Being used by small number of prescribers
4.3.2: BMI/Photo Veri cation Guidance for Repeat Orders
Scenario 1: Repeat Customer with Borderline BMI
Situation: Initial photo suggests borderline BMI
Action: If determined safe, continue treatment in line with previous prescriber's decision
Rationale: Maintain continuity of care and ensure smooth patient experience
Clinical Decision: Risks of delaying treatment outweigh bene ts as repeating process
doesn't add clinical value
Speci c Actions:
Do NOT request new photo
Do NOT apply Weight Veri cation Failed tag
Do NOT place order on hold
Scenario 2: Repeat Customer Appearing Underweight
Situation: Initial photos indicate patient underweight
Action: Use designated email macro "Repeat Customer WeightHeight Veri cation"
Purpose: Request veri ed height and weight from patient
Clinical Assumption: Previous decision appears to be genuine error

order:
Prescribe order
Email patient "Clinical PUE 2 Weeks Old"
Inform them NOT to start new treatment until completed existing course
NHS Treatment Restriction
If patient already receiving GLP1 treatment on NHS: Treatment cannot be continued
privately
Exception: If NHS treatment ceased, previous NHS prescription can be used as
evidence
Condition: Fits the email requirements
Below Licence BMI Without Evidence
If BMI below licence but 25 and proof of previous supply evidence cannot be
provided:
Do NOT change dose on order
Patient NOT eligible unless can provide both proof of supply AND previous BMI
veri cation photo
Use Clinical Evidence of Starting BMI email template on interface
PUE Failure Response
If proof of previous supply evidence not accepted:
Add tag "Pending Customer Response"
Place order on-hold after email sent
Reference macro on interface to assist with request
Previous BMI Veri cation Photo Failure
If previous BMI veri cation photo doesn't meet requirements:
Apply tag "previous BMI veri cation failed"
Remove "prescriber review" tag
Place order on hold
Manually send personalized email explaining why photo not met
requirements
RULE: Do NOT use "weight veri cation failed" tag (confuses patients as CRM
worded for current BMI)
Combined Failure Protocol
If both proof of previous supply AND previous BMI veri cation photo fail:
Send ONE combined email covering both issues
Titration Check - Repeat Patient Order
Titration Assessment Criteria
Check if patients on 2nd order of GLP1 titrate up in strength as expected
Reference: GLP1 titration guide in Appendix 10
Same Dose Continuation
If patient continues on same dose (does not titrate up) or goes down in strength:
ACTION: Prescribe and contact patient afterwards
Patient Skipping Dose Response
If customer skips dose:
Contact customer to provide options
Options found in Clinical Evidence Request Skipped Dose GLP1 macro on
interface:
1. We can amend their order to correct dose per titration guide
2. Patient can provide evidence of being prescribed missing dose with
alternative provider
After Sending Clinical Evidence Request:
Tag "Pending Customer Response"
Wait to hear back from patient
Same Strength/Downward Titration
If patient stays on same strength or goes down:
ACTION: Prescribe order and contact patient afterwards
Use Clinical Did Not Titrate Up/Went Down in Strength GLP1 macro on
prescribing interface
Macro advises patient to contact MedExpress if need support with side
e ects/dose selection
Reference: Appendix 4 for email instructions
Safe Note: If patient steps down by 1 dose, safe to prescribe
Order does NOT need to be placed on-hold
Continued Same Dose History
If patient continues ordering same dose and "did not titrate" macro already sent:
If patient responded with justi able reasons: No need to continue sending "did
not titrate" emails
Justi able Reasons Could Include: (not limited to)
Exceptional Circumstance: Dosage Pattern
Exceptional circumstance: Patient appears to skip dose when titrate up, decrease,
then request higher dose within 8 weeks
Detailed Example:
Titrated up correctly to Mounjaro 10mg
Subsequent order for Mounjaro 5mg (prescribed and "did not titrate" macro
sent)
Next order for Mounjaro 10mg again
Appears to have skipped dose within 8 weeks period
Action: Send Clinical Evidence Request Skipped Dose GLP1 macro
Process Consideration:
When order of 5mg not considered and dates of 10mg pens taken account
Patient eligible for 10mg pen
Careful consideration of patient responses to both macros
If justi cation raises no clinical concerns: Proceed to prescribe requested dose
Acceptable Justi cations Could Include: (not limited to)
Cost meant patient ordered lower dose as interim measure
Wanted to see if could achieve weight loss at lower dosage
Order was accidental
Titration or next dose unavailable due to stock issues
Titration Rules by Medication
Di erent titration rules with di erent medications:
Mounjaro and Wegovy: Titration up each month, progressing to next dose
Nevolat: Titration performed weekly, where [speci c guidance provided]
Additional Consideration:
Justi able reasons included: "The patient is seeing positive results from their
treatment at a lower dose..."
Other reasons: "The side e ects they are experiencing are minimal and manageable"
Financial factors: "The patient would struggle to a ord the increased price for
increased doses..."

Appendix 8: Guidelines for Assessing Photos
Page Reference: 57-60
Photo Assessment Framework
Body Composition Assessment Philosophy
Endomorph vs Mesomorph Assessment:
Endomorphs: May exercise frequently, substantial muscle mass BUT also high
visceral/body fat
Increased risk cardiovascular and metabolic conditions
Good candidates for weight loss intervention
Mesomorphs: Larger frame with muscle can appear larger without high BMI
Assessment must account for muscle vs fat distribution
Face Assessment
Areas to Assess:
Plumper or rounded facial appearance (overweight indication)
Noticeable fat accumulations beneath chin or cheek area
Neck and Collarbone Assessment
Areas to Assess:
Substantial neck (elevated BMI indicator)
Absence of noticeable collarbones (elevated BMI indicator)
Torso Assessment
Shoulder Width:
Wider shoulders may suggest bigger frame and possibly higher BMI
Upper Arms:
Indications of surplus fat or muscle tone
Waist and Hips Assessment
Waist-to-Hip Ratio:
Broader waist with slimmer hips suggests higher BMI
Abdominal Appearance:
Noticeable abdominal fat or surplus weight
Legs and Lower Limbs Assessment
Lower Limb Evaluation:
Broader thighs or calves (additional weight indication)
General balance of lower body to upper body
Body Shape Assessment
Overall Shape Analysis:
Noticeable body shapes suggesting surplus fat
Particularly torso, stomach, and hip areas
Clothing Assessment
Clothing Considerations:
Snug clothing accentuates body contours
Loose clothing can conceal body contours
Belts/waistbands provide size indications
Posture and Pose Assessment
Body Position Impact:
Slumping or resting on item can impact body size perception
Stance a ects BMI perception
Context and Background Assessment
Scale Reference:
Items or individuals present as reference for scale
Door frame, mirror height, other people in vicinity
Determines apparent person size

Presented as upper roof/guidance
Clinical Decision:
If clinical reason for step table not followed: Document on patient's record
Appendix 11: Appropriate Rationale for Switching
Between GLP1s
Page Reference: 61-62
Switching Scenarios and Guidance
Scenario 1: Weight Loss Plateau
Situation: Patient weight loss plateaued, on medication several months
Guidance: May be appropriate to approve switch
Action: If switch approved, inform patient of approval and prescribe lowest dose of new
medication
Scenario 2: Minimal Weight Loss, Short Duration
Situation: Patient not lost weight, only on medication few months
Guidance: May be appropriate to approve switch
Additional Guidance: Counsel patient on appropriate expectations and encourage
continuing current medication until 6-month review
Exception: If patient still keen to change, approve if clinically eligible
Scenario 3: Medication Out of Stock
Situation: Medication unavailable
Guidance: Con rm availability of new medication and approve switch if adequate supplies
Scenario 4: Mild Side E ects
Situation: Patient reports mild side e ects
Guidance: Mild/moderate side e ects common to both GLP1s, won't justify immediate
switch
Management: Use Side E ects Macros on Prescribing Interface and ZenDesk
Guidance: Provide advice on managing side e ects
Scenario 5: Dose Adjustment on Switch
Protocol: When switching to di erent GLP1, start at lowest dose
Email Content: Include detailed dosage and administration instructions for new
medication
Exceptional Circumstance: Product Out of Stock
Con rm new medication availability
Approve switch if supplies adequate

Greeting
"Hi [Patient First Name],
Step 1B
Step 1B
We hope you're well and thank you for trusting MedExpress with your weight loss journey.
Your prescription for Nevolat has now been issued and being sent to our dispensary for
dispatch!
We'd like to make sure you have everything you need to start safely and con dently."
Section 1: Your Dose
"The dose of Nevolat you receive depends on the volume of liquid injected. During the rst 4
weeks of treatment, you will increase the dose of Nevolat each week by increasing the
volume of liquid you inject."
Week 1
"To start your weight loss journey, please set your pen to the following dose and inject at
this dose for the rst week: 0.6 mg per day"
Week 2
"Increase the dosage on your pen to 1.2 mg per day"
Week 3
"Increase the dosage on your pen to 1.8mg per day
If you are not able to select your full dose on your pen, this means it does not contain
enough medication for your next dose. In this case, please use your next pen and select the
dose from there."
Week 4
"Increase the dosage on your pen to 2.4mg per day
Please note - you will need to start using the 3rd pen in your pack this week."
Week 5 and Onwards
"Increase the dosage on your pen to 3mg per day
Continue to use this dose steadily throughout your treatment.
If you have ordered a 3 pen starter pack, then your 3rd pen will run out in week 5 and you
will need to order more pens to continue your weight loss journey."
Section 2: How to Use Your Nevolat Pen
"You can nd clear video guides and written instructions on the o cial Nevolat website - ht
tps://liraglutide.co.uk/nevolat-patient/taking-nevolat/how-to-prepare-your-pen
On this page you will nd short videos and information covering:
How to prepare and use your pen correctly
How to store it safely
What to do if you miss a dose"
Section 3: Switching to Nevolat
"It's really important to make sure that you are not taking 2 GLP-1 medications at the same
time. Because you are switching from a weekly injection to a daily injection, please make
sure you do not start your Nevolat pen until you are due to take your next weekly injection.
Then, you can transition smoothly to injecting Nevolat daily safely."
Closing
"If you have any questions or would like to discuss your treatment further, please contact
our support team.
Thank you for your continued trust in our service. We're here to make your GLP-1 journey
as smooth and safe as possible.
Warm regards,

"Hi [Patient First Name],
We hope you're well.
Your prescription for Nevolat has now been issued and being sent to our dispensary for
dispatch!
We'd like to make sure you have everything you need to start safely and con dently."
Section 1: Your Dose
"As you are able to tolerate GLP1s, we are pleased to inform you that you do not need to
start on the lowest dose of Nevolat.
Please set your Nevolat pen to the following dose: [insert patient-speci c dose - XX]
This dose matches your previous treatment step, so you can continue your weight loss
journey without interruption.
If you experience any new or unexpected side e ects, please contact us or your clinician
promptly.
A week after you have been on this dose, please increase your dose to the next dose in 0.6
increments.
For example, if you are now on 1.8, on your next week of Nevolat increase to 2.4mg and the
following week to 3mg, until you reach 3mg."
Special Instruction
"If the patient is not eligible to switch to Nevolat on a dose of 3mg daily, refer to the new
patients macro and identify the Nevolat dose that patient will start on and provide
guidance on titrating up to 3mg.
Example: If patient was on 5mg Mounjaro, they start at 2.4mg Nevolat and should be
informed to increase Nevolat dose weekly until at 3mg"
